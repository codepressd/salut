### Why I Built It

I work in the Restaurant Industry and I wanted an easy way to be able to order from all my suppliers in one fell swoop. I the restaurant I currently manage, we have well over 20 different suppliers and many have over 5000 products. So I set out to create an app that could make ordering a bit easier for professionals like myself.

### Technology Used

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongodb

## Things To Work On

This project has a long way to go before I will be happy with it. Right now it is pretty much at as barebones as it could be. Here are some features I would like to add:

### For Suppliers

- pdf/excel import for suppliers
-  Support for multiple Reps
- Support both being a supplier but also have the ability to order


###For Restaurants

- A better search feature when shopping
- A place to view all your suppliers and add your specific customer number
- Update your cart with previous orders to simplify the ordering process
- Sort what you have purchased by supplier
