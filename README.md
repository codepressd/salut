# Salut - Universal Ordering App

A platform where you can accomplish all your ordering in one place. Order from mulitple different suppliers all at once.

### Why I Built It

I work in the Restaurant Industry and I wanted an easy way to be able to order from all my suppliers in one fell swoop. 

### Technology Used

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- Mongodb
- Javascript


### Things To Work On

This project has a long way to go before I will be happy with it. Right now it is pretty much at as barebones as it could be. Here are some features I would like to add:

## For Suppliers

- pdf/excel import for suppliers
-  Support for multiple Reps
- Support both being a supplier but also have the ability to order


##For Restaurants

- A better search feature when shopping
- A place to view all your suppliers and add your specific customer number
- Update your cart with previous orders to simplify the ordering process
- Sort what you have purchased by supplier
